# physics-kit

The optional finite-element component: KARMA's FEM core, physics modules (advection-reaction,
diffusion-reaction, Gray-Scott), FEM transfer and the Runge-Kutta/Rosenbrock integrator
family, ported into `fuse::` following [](integrators-design.md)'s design for the temporal
integrators. At present no physics code exists under `physics-kit/` -- only the directory, the build
option, the two gates and one placeholder test described below.

## What it is, and what it is not

physics-kit is a **separate optional component**, not one of the `fuse::` layers
[](layering.md) enumerates. It depends on FUSE -- the `fuse::physics_kit` target links
`fuse::runtime`, `fuse::backend`, `fuse::num` and the `fuse::linalg` facade
(`physics-kit/CMakeLists.txt`) -- and FUSE never depends back on it: nothing under `include/fuse/`,
`src/`, `python/` or `examples/` may include a `fuse_physics/` header or link `fuse::physics_kit`.
That direction is what keeps FUSE adoptable by a code that already has its own discretisation
([](layering.md)'s own wording). The namespace is `fuse::physics`; headers live under
`physics-kit/include/fuse_physics/`.

## Tier and how to enable it

physics-kit is **tier 0**: it needs nothing beyond what `fuse::runtime`, `fuse::backend`,
`fuse::num` and `fuse::linalg` already need at tier 0 (Kokkos, fmt), so `FUSE_ENABLE_PHYSICS_KIT`
(`cmake/FuseDependencies.cmake`) defaults **ON** -- unlike `FUSE_ENABLE_PYTHON`/`FUSE_ENABLE_FORTRAN`,
which default OFF because they add a real third-party dependency physics-kit does not. PETSc is
**optional**, read through the existing `FUSE_HAVE_PETSC` define (`fuse/base/config.hpp`) with no
new `find_package(PETSc)` call of its own: a physics-kit source guards PETSc-dependent code with
`#if FUSE_HAVE_PETSC`, the same pattern `examples/dn_heat/main.cpp` and
`examples/petsc_reaction_diffusion/main.cpp` already use, and `physics-kit/CMakeLists.txt` links
`fuse::petsc` only when `FUSE_ENABLE_PETSC` is on.

```
cmake -S . -B build -DFUSE_ENABLE_PHYSICS_KIT=ON    # default; needs nothing beyond tier 0
cmake -S . -B build -DFUSE_ENABLE_PHYSICS_KIT=OFF   # skip the component entirely
```

## The gates

Two static checks keep the boundary and the naming honest, both run as part of `tools/check-
layering.py`'s and the new `tools/check-physics-kit-naming.py`'s CI job:

- **Layering** (`tools/check-layering.py`'s `check_physics_kit_boundary`): refuses a
  `#include ".../fuse_physics/..."` or a `fuse::physics_kit` link anywhere under `include/fuse/`,
  `src/`, `python/` or `examples/`. physics-kit/ itself is exempt -- it is the one place allowed to
  name any `fuse::` layer, by construction.
- **Naming** (`tools/check-physics-kit-naming.py`): refuses a `KARMA*` type prefix, a `karma_` file
  prefix or a `.C` extension anywhere under `physics-kit/` -- the three rules [](porting.md)'s
  naming map states for code arriving from `upstream/karma`, applied here because physics-kit is
  outside the four directories `tools/check-layering.py`'s own naming check already covers.

Both gates were proven to fire against a probe file (added, run, shown to produce a violation,
removed) before being accepted.

## Contents

No physics code lives under `physics-kit/` yet. What exists is the directory layout, the
`fuse::physics_kit` target with one placeholder translation unit, the `physics.skeleton` gtest
(asserts a version string and that `FUSE_HAVE_PETSC` reaches physics-kit code), the two gates above,
and this page. [](integrators-design.md) is the design for the integrators that will be ported here.

## Not installed

`fuse_physics_kit` is not in the package's `install(TARGETS ... EXPORT fuse-coupler-targets)` set:
that export is closed inside `src/CMakeLists.txt` (`install(EXPORT ...)` at its end), which runs before
the root adds `physics-kit/`, so a contribution from here would arrive after the export is written.
Shipping physics-kit needs its own export set and a `find_package` component, which becomes
worthwhile once the component carries code a consumer would link. `tools/check-invariants.py` scans
`physics-kit/`; `tools/check-layering.py`'s third-party-header rules are not applied to physics-kit's
own public headers.
